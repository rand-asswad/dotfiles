# Dotfiles

Having embraced the minimalist linux philosophy for almost 3 years now,
it's time for me to share my dotfiles on github, with the double
benefit of version control and backup.

Like all dotfiles, this is barely my own work, I have mostly selected
dotfiles that I found useful and elegant.

I use Arch Linux and run [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)/[i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3).
